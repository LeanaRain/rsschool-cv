## About me
My name is Leana. I am forty one years old. 
Ever since school i dreamed of going to study at Information Technology. At school I studied very well in almost all subjects. But until the 9th grade at my school, physics was self-study. So I scored low in physics and could not go  to the university in information technology. So I had to choose another specialty. 4 years I tried to get into IT. On 4 year I passed the competition! But at that time I was already studying economics for free. And in order to enroll in IT, I had to return the money for all 4 years of studying economics or quit studying and start from scratch. However, I already wrote a diploma, but there was no money. The dream had to be abandoned. Now I want to try again to get closer to my dream...
Besides my real job with finance has low wages and no prospects.
## Scills
I have strong analytical skills, that helped me in any activity, whatever I did.
I have a really good imagination.
Perhaps stress-resistant (5+ years of work as a moderator killed my nervous system). But I prefer not to check it.
I have a great sence of humor.
I have some other useful skills, but I think they are not important here.
## Code examples

## Education
I graduated from university with a degree in Economics. 
**I have an honors degree**.
## Experience
I do not have experience in JS development.
I have a little experience in Gamedevelopment. I worked in a small game as a content manager, tester and moderator. I am invented and created quests for players, different attack scenes. And tested its. Also i tested updates of game  manually. 
I did quests on a turnkey basis: I came up with a plot, divided it into stages, wrote texts and entered it into the database, linked tables in the database, game elements, set prizes and drop percentage, then tested what happened .. and then answered to the questions of the players why such a bad drop =) It was a fun time...
But unfortunately it was not my most work`s experience. It was my side job for about 5 years in my free time.
My most work is analist, finance and taxes. This is what I have been doing for the last 18 years.
Also i have a little experience in recruitment, including IT-recruitment.
## Languages
*    **Russian**
I speak and write russian perfectly.
*    **English**
I am learning english now. I really love english and i want more practicing english. 
But i know than i have really a lot of mistakes.
To be honest, I would rate my English no higher А1-А2. I can write and read simple sentences without a dictionary. But I still do not know many words and do not understand oral speech well.
*    **German**
I learned german in school. It was twenty years ago. And i do not remember much it.
# My hobby
In my free time i love to play videogames and to read. 
But now i do not have free time. I learn here and i learn English.
